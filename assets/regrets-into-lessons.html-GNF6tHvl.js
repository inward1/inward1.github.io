Practices such as journaling can provide clarity and help uncover patterns in your behavior or decision-making processes.</p><h3 id="💠-cultivate-self-compassion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#💠-cultivate-self-compassion"><span><strong>💠 Cultivate Self-Compassion</strong></span></a></h3><p>Treat yourself with the same kindness you would offer a friend.
