Most religions are tools for keeping as many beings stuck in 3D as possible, it’s their purpose. They’re not about ascending nor they’re about awakening, they’re about descending deeper into the dirt, into the 3D.</p><h2 id="the-single-true-god" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-single-true-god"><span>The Single, True God</span></a></h2><p>The truth is that a single, true god exists. In its entirety, it’s not being but rather <strong>everything that exists</strong>. This is the core teaching of Advaita Vedanta. It’s you, it’s me, it’s every particle in the cosmos, it’s every plane of reality, it’s every being in all planes of reality.</p><p>Ponder for a moment… A single cell from your hand, what is it? It’s a cell, of course. However, it’s also you. Without the cells that make up your body, you wouldn’t exist, and without you, the cells wouldn’t exist.</p><h2 id="the-single-false-god-the-demiurge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-single-false-god-the-demiurge"><span>The Single, False God: The Demiurge</span></a></h2><p>Similarly, the truth is that a single, false god exists. It’s a being just like us, a being similar to the fantasy “God” in Christianity. This intelligent being is not a true god in its entirety, even though it’s a god just like you, me, and every atom in existence. It’s a subordinate god, a false god, ruling over the 3rd dimension.</p><p>Plato gave him a name: “Demiurge.” He adapted the term, which in ancient Greece had originally been the ordinary word for “craftsman” or “artisan.” Theoretically, both you and I could be the Demiurge because we’re also beings, but we are not Demiurge. The Demiurge is the God of the 3rd Dimension but has no more power than you do beyond it. It isn’t benevolent (good), like the Christian God, and it isn’t malevolent (evil), like the Gnostic God. It crafted and controls the entire material world as we know it; it defined the golden ratio and all other things we study in physics, chemistry, biology, etc., but not in quantum physics.</p><p>It’s also indirectly behind the creation and prolongation of all major world religions. He has subordinates who act under his will here on Earth. They are called “Archons” by the Gnostics; they control and manage Christianity, Judaism, and all other major religions.</p><h2 id="gnosticism-inward1-and-the-dance-of-wisdom" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gnosticism-inward1-and-the-dance-of-wisdom"><span>Gnosticism, Inward1, and the Dance of Wisdom</span></a></h2><p>Plato’s term “Demiurge” was later adopted by some of the Gnostics. Gnosticism is a disputed term, and the groups conventionally considered gnostic were not part of a single movement, so treating their belief systems as uniform is problematic. Before Christianity, Gnostic ideas were already present. The soul known as Jesus shares way more with Gnostic beliefs than modern Christian views.</p><p>The wisdom within gnostic movements often shines, yet it is frequently dimmed by the foolhardy insistence on dualism—a peculiar dance of wisdom and foolishness that leaves one both perplexed and amused. Inward1 is in its essence a gnostic movement, but it really should not be categorized as gnostic since true teachings of ancient gnostics were corrupted, twisted, and altered into this stupid evil god dualistic narrative. Inward1 can be considered a Gnostic movement without the illusion of dualism.</p><h2 id="the-divine-purpose-of-the-demiurge" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-divine-purpose-of-the-demiurge"><span>The Divine Purpose of the Demiurge</span></a></h2><p>The divine purpose of the Demiurge is to make ascension into the higher planes as hard as possible for all beings stuck in the realm he controls (3D). Gnostics considered his purpose evil, but that’s just a stupid idea.</p><p>Games are built around challenges and progression to give players purpose and engagement. Without hardships or obstacles, the sense of accomplishment fades, making gameplay feel shallow. Progression systems, like leveling up, unlocking new areas, or mastering skills, motivate players to invest time and immerse themselves. Lacking these elements, a game loses depth and motivation, leading to disinterest and little replay value. Hence, a game devoid of these critical components would fail to capture players’ attention or provide a meaningful experience.</p><p>Without challenges, there would be no obstacles to overcome, leading to a lack of excitement and motivation. Progression gives players a feeling of achievement and growth, enhancing their investment in the game. Without these elements, a game would lose its dynamic nature, becoming monotonous and uninteresting, ultimately leading to its non-existence.</p><h2 id="escaping-the-trap-of-the-third-dimension" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#escaping-the-trap-of-the-third-dimension"><span>Escaping the Trap of the Third Dimension</span></a></h2><p>Souls become trapped in the third dimension (3D), a realm of physicality and separation, due to attachments to physical experiences, fear of change, and unresolved emotional issues. These attachments hinder spiritual growth and prevent progression to higher realms characterized by unity, love, and higher consciousness.</p><p>To escape this trap, one must transcend physical limitations through self-awareness, healing, and embracing higher vibrational states.</p>',21)]))}const d=i(s,[["render",o],["__file","gnosticism.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse('{"path":"/illuminations/gnosticism.html","title":"Gnosticism and the Demiurge","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Gnosticism and the Demiurge","shortTitle":"Gnosticism","icon":"cloud-meatball","category":["Illuminations"],"description":"Society has never been designed with our personal best interests at heart, and this will never change.
