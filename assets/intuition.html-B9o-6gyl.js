Solitude amplifies these signals, allowing the inner voice to emerge undistorted by the world’s noise.</li><li><strong>The Outgoing Soul:</strong> Bold and boisterous, the extrovert’s intuition might crash in like a symphony—vivid dreams shared at a party, gut-punch insights in conversation, or an electric buzz during social flow.

Could this empathy network also be a portal through which collective soul-energy flows?
